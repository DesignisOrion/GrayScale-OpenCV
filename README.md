# GrayScale-OpenCV

### About 
Working with OpenCV generating a frame for Color and Grayscale.

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- OpenCV 


### What I learned:

OpenCV stands for Open Computer Vision which has taken my mind to a whole new level. So what's OpenCV? Well OpenCV allows you to everything from Face Recognition, Image Detection and so much more. Today I was able to install and work with the library to get a few things up and going. A few things such as installing OpenCV using pip, creating output of webcam on the computer as well as recording video was done today. To install simply type pip install opencv-contrib-python --upgrade within the python directory via terminal. To terminate please be sure to use the 'q' key while frames are shown. Hope you enjoy.
